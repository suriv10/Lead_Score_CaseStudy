 ### Lead Scoring Case Study ###
 
__Problem Statement:__
An education company named X Education sells online courses to industry professionals. On any given day, many professionals who are interested in the courses land on their website and browse for courses. 
The company markets its courses on several websites and search engines like Google. Once these people land on the website, they might browse the courses or fill up a form for the course or watch some videos. When these people fill up a form providing their email address or phone number, they are classified to be a lead. Moreover, the company also gets leads through past referrals. Once these leads are acquired, employees from the sales team start making calls, writing emails, etc. Through this process, some of the leads get converted while most do not. The typical lead conversion rate at X education is around 30%. 
Now, although X Education gets a lot of leads, its lead conversion rate is very poor. To make this process more efficient, the company wishes to identify the most potential leads, also known as ‘Hot Leads’. If they successfully identify this set of leads, the lead conversion rate should go up as the sales team will now be focusing more on communicating with the potential leads rather than making calls to everyone.

__Goal of the Case Study:__
Build a logistic regression model to assign a lead score between 0 and 100 to each of the leads which can be used by the company to target potential leads. A higher score would mean that the lead is hot, i.e. is most likely to convert whereas a lower score would mean that the lead is cold and will mostly not get converted.

__Files included:-__
1. A well-commented Jupyter notebook giving the logistic regression model, the conversion predictions and evaluation metrics.
2. A document filled with solutions to all the problems.
3. The overall approach we followed of the analysis in a presentation.
4. A brief summary explaining how we proceeded with the assignment and the learnings that we gathered.
